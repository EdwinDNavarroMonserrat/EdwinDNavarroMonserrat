## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Edwin D. Navarro Monserrat
# Background
I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I obtained my B.S. in Cell and Molecular Biology from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras and a M.S. in Plant Pathology from The Ohio State University. Currently, I'm near the end of my PhD, in Plant Pathology. My research has focused on the used of a collection of biocontrol _Pseudomonas_ for the management of _Pythium_ induced diseases in hydroponically grown leafy greens. In addition to this, a large portion of my efforts have been spent in performing various genome-wide analysis on this collection of _Pseudomonas_. In particular, I have experience performing genome mining, phylogenetic analysis, and pangenome analysis. 

# Interest
Iâ€™m interested in bioinformatics, microbiology, molecular biology, and plant pathology ðŸŒ±. Iâ€™m looking to continue to expand my skillset in bioinformatics, molecular biology and data analysis.
